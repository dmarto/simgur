simple imgur post viewer

Allows you to open imgur post with javascript blocked on the imgur
domain, and provides you simplified (but better, imho) experience.


FEATURES
--------
 - simple single page gallery, smooth scrolling
   - lazy loading of images (browser native control)
   - next & prev key-binds (j/k & up/down)
   - video/image elements are given maximum viewport
 - bypass "sign-on required" and "age verification" using embed mode
 - all (known to me) non file pages, are overwritten with our view


TODO
----
 - title of post
 - title of elements?
 - description of elements?
 - click on item -> open direct link in new tab
 - fast forward support in gallery
 - create our own posts for testing all options
 - write better README (pls, help)
 - posts that are in sub-reddits gallery/context, have strange urls

NOTE
----

As I use only Violentmonkey, this may not work under other userscript
managers. PRs are welcome to fix problems with other, as long as they
don't break functionality under Violentmonkey.
